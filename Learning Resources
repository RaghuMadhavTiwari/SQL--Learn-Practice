SQL is so important!!!!

SQL is one of the key languages used by Data folks.. whether a Data Analyst, Data Scienctist, Business Analyst or a Data Engineer. 
I have put together tons of resources from where one can learn SQL for free.

1. Learn PostgreSQL Tutorial  - [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw--VYLpxG4)   
Learn how to use PostgreSQL in this full course. PostgreSQL is a general purpose and object-relational database management system.   

2. Learn SQL Basics for Data Science Specialization  [Coursera Course link)[https://www.coursera.org/specializations/learn-sql-basics-data-science]   |This Specialization is intended for a learner with no previous coding experience seeking to develop SQL query fluency. Through four progressively more difficult SQL projects with data science applications, you will cover topics such as SQL basics, data wrangling, SQL analysis, AB testing, distributed computing using Apache Spark, and more. These topics will prepare you to apply SQL creatively to analyze and explore data; demonstrate efficiency in writing queries; create data analysis datasets; conduct feature engineering, use SQL with other data analysis and machine learning toolsets; and use SQL with unstructured data sets(Financial Aid Available).    |
